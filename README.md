# Abstract

<br /> In contrast to appetitive studies, motivation in the aversive domain has not
<br /> been given much attention. Utilizing the Pavlovian to instrumental transfer (PIT) 
<br /> paradigm, where a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) that has been paired with 
<br /> an unconditioned stimulus (US) facilitates instrumental avoidance responses, this 
<br /> study examined the neural basis of how Pavlovian signals can invigorate instrumental 
<br /> responses under two distinct conditions. CS1 (e.g., tone) is a threat signifying 
<br /> oncoming shock while CS2 (e.g., noise) predicts a klaxon. Both CSs are capable of
<br /> elevating ongoing shock-avoidance behavior rates, but through distinct psychological
<br /> processes (i.e., sensory-specific versus sensory-general). Using chemogenetics, 
<br /> we inhibited neural activity in the basal (BA) or central (CeA) amygdala during 
<br /> tests for these different forms of motivation. BA inactivation reduced specific 
<br /> (i.e., shock) but not general (i.e., klaxon) motivation. Inhibition of central 
<br /> amygdala reduced both specific and general motivation. These data suggest that 
<br /> threat processing in the aversive domain may depend on internal representations 
<br /> that do not conform to what has been found in appetitive studies.

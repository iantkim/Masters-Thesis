In contrast to appetitive studies, motivation in the aversive domain has not been given much
attention. Utilizing the Pavlovian to instrumental transfer (PIT) paradigm, where a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) that has been paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US) facilitates instrumental avoidance responses, this study examined the neural basis of how Pavlovian signals can invigorate instrumental responses under two distinct conditions. CS1 (e.g., tone) is a threat signifying oncoming shock while CS2 (e.g., noise) predicts a klaxon. Both CSs are capable of elevating ongoing shock-avoidance behavior rates, but through distinct psychological processes (i.e., sensory-specific versus sensory-general). Using chemogenetics, we inhibited neural activity in the basal (BA) or central (CeA) amygdala during tests for these different forms of motivation. BA inactivation reduced specific (i.e., shock) but not general (i.e., klaxon) motivation. Inhibition of central amygdala reduced both specific and general motivation. These data suggest that threat processing in the aversive domain may depend on internal representations that do not conform to what has been found in appetitive studies.
